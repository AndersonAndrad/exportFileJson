# Project for exporting files

## Why this project

this projects was created with the proposal to export files, this for several types of extensions.

## Why I used this technology

I used this technology to export files, due to the need to check so much information simultaneously in the same file. I recommend this technology when you don't have an extension that it doesn't export or when you need to provide information to the user.

## How it work

it's a function that receives three parameters, the information that goes in the file, the name of the file and type to be exported, in this case I created a function that receives the three parameters checks some things and the passes this to the export function, it already returns the files itself.
